# MovieFlix

This project is built using ReactJS and Vite, two popular web development technologies. Its main purpose is to provide users with information about the latest movies. It achieves this by connecting to the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch data about these films.

Here are some of the key features of the project:

1. **Latest Movies**: Users can easily find information about the most recent movies released. The project connects to the TMDB API to get this up-to-date data.

2. **Genre-Based Search**: Users have the option to filter movies by genre. This means they can select categories like action, comedy, horror, sci-fi, and more, and the application will display movies specific to their chosen genre.

3. **Trailers**: The project provides users with access to movie trailers. This means you can watch a trailer of a movie you're interested in before deciding to watch it.

4. **Related Videos**: In addition to the trailer, the project offers related videos. This may include behind-the-scenes clips, interviews, or additional content related to the movie.

5. **Cast Information**: Users can also explore details about the actors and characters in a particular movie. This is helpful for those who want to know more about the people behind the film.
